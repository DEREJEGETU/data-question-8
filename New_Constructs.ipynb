      "Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Principles\n",
      "The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. were\n",
      "prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\n",
      "GAAP\") and include the accounts of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries\n",
      "(\"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" the \"Company,\" \"Air Products,\" or \"registrant\"), which are generally majority owned.\n",
      "Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\n",
      "We consolidate all entities that we control. The general condition for control is ownership of\n",
      "a majority of the voting interests of an entity. Control may also exist in arrangements where we are the\n",
      "primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). An entity that has both the power to direct the\n",
      "activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a VIE and the obligation to absorb the\n",
      "losses or receive the benefits significant to the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary of that entity. We\n",
      "have determined that we are not a primary beneficiary in any material VIE.\n",
      "Reclassifications\n",
      "The results of the divisions comprising the former Materials Technologies\n",
      "segment and the former Energy‑from‑Waste segment have been presented as discontinued operations. Refer to\n",

      "in the consolidated balance sheets. The comprehensive income related to these businesses has not been\n",
      "segregated and is included in the consolidated comprehensive income statement for all periods presented. The\n",
      "notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated, are on a continuing operations\n",
      "basis. The term \"total company\" includes both continuing and discontinued operations.\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes reflect\n",
      "accounting guidance that was adopted during fiscal year 2017.\n",
      "Refer to Note 2, New Accounting\n",
      "Guidance, for additional information. Certain prior year information has been\n",

      "Estimates and Assumptions\n",
      "The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\n",

      "customer (which generally occurs at the time shipment is made), the sales price is fixed or determinable, and\n",
      "collectability is reasonably assured. Sales returns and allowances are not a business practice in the\n",
      "industry.\n",
      "Revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the\n",
      "percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenue from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied\n",
      "natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers and large air separation units, is recognized based on costs or labor hours\n",
      "incurred to date compared with total estimated costs or labor hours to be incurred. When adjustments in\n",
      "estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs or labor hours are required, any changes in the\n",
      "estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of\n",
      "such change. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method favorably\n",
      "impacted operating income by approximately $27 in fiscal\n",
      "year 2017 and approximately $20 in fiscal year 2016. Our\n",

      "Fair Value Measurements\n",
      "We are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value,\n",

      "Accounting Guidance Implemented in 2017\n",
      "Simplifying Goodwill Impairment Test\n",
      "In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify\n",
      "the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2, which measured the impairment loss based on the fair\n",
      "value of goodwill. Under the new guidance, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the\n",
      "carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill\n",
      "allocated to that reporting unit. The guidance is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairments tests\n",
      "conducted in fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied prospectively. We elected\n",
      "to early adopt this guidance during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\n",
      "Share-Based Compensation\n",
      "In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to simplify the accounting for\n",
      "employee share-based payments, including the income tax impacts, the classification on the statement of cash\n",
      "flows, and forfeitures. We elected to early adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The\n",
      "new guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in the income statement rather than\n",
      "in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. As a result of applying this change prospectively, we\n",
      "recognized $17.6 of excess tax benefits in our provision for\n",
      "income taxes during fiscal year 2017. In addition, adoption of the new guidance resulted in an\n",
      "$8.8 cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of 1\n",
      "October 2016 to recognize deferred taxes for U.S. state net operating loss and other carryforwards attributable\n",
      "to excess tax benefits. We retrospectively applied the guidance on cash flow presentation, which requires\n",
      "excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity rather than as a financing activity. Cash paid on\n",
      "employees' behalf related to shares withheld for tax purposes continues to be classified as a financing\n",
