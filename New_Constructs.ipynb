Under Delaware state law, these shares are not   retired, and we have the right to resell any of the shares repurchased. Beginning in April 2015, under this   program, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (\"ASRs\") with a financial institution. In   exchange for up-front payments, the financial institution delivered shares of our common stock during the   purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average   repurchase price paid per share, was determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR   based on the volume weighted-average price of our common stock during that period. The up-front payments for   the treasury stock were accounted for as a reduction to shareholders\\' equity in the consolidated balance   sheet in the periods the payments are made. We reflected each ASR as a repurchase of common stock in the   period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to our own   common stock. Each ASR met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore, was not   accounted for as a derivative instrument',\n",
