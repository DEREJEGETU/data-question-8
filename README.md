New Constructs Share Repurchase Data Collection Project
New Constructs is interested in using NLP and machine learning technology to accurately
collect data on share repurchase plans from paragraph text in 10-Ks and 10-Qs. This document
explains the desired results and provides a training/sample data set.
Background
The 2017 tax reform law lowered the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Many U.S.
companies have decided to use some of the additional profits they will realize in 2018 as a
result of this lower tax rate to repurchase common shares. They have authorized new, larger
share repurchase plans. Companies are disclosing information about their share repurchase
intentions in their SEC filings. These disclosures are commonly in paragraph form in the notes
to the financial statements. Analysts are interested in this information, and New Constructs
would like to collect this information automatically using NLP and machine learning tools.
